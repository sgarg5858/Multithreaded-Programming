1.Consider a scenario where you have a big computation and you want to split it into multiple sub-tasks which are executed 
by multiple threads with each thread working on a part of the task.
Once all the threads are finished with their tasks you can combine the partial results to get the result of the computation.
2.Designing this scenario with Runnable makes it difficult as Runnable doesnâ€™t return a result. 
That shortcoming is filled by Callable in Java as it can return a result and may throw an exception.

Callable interface in Java has a single method call which computes a result and returns it or throws an exception if unable to do so.

So, you need to implement call() method to provide the task that has to be implemented by a thread as an asynchronous computation. 

package ExecuterServiceDemo;

import java.util.Date;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class CallableDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ExecutorService executor=Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
		Date date=new Date();
		System.out.println("Time before task:"+date);
		Future<String>future=executor.submit(()->{
			TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(15);
			return "Value";
		});
		System.out.println("Time After submitting task:"+new Date());
		
		try {
			System.out.println("getting result:"+future.get()+"a:t"+new Date());
		} catch (InterruptedException e) {
			// TODO Auto-generated catch block
			e.printStackTrace();
		} catch (ExecutionException e) {
			// TODO Auto-generated catch block
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		executor.shutdown();

	}

}

Output:
Time before task:Wed Jan 15 15:26:02 IST 2020
Time After submitting task:Wed Jan 15 15:26:02 IST 2020
getting result:Valuea:tWed Jan 15 15:26:17 IST 2020

from output it is clear that code execution doesn't wait for result from callable interface but goes on and the result from callable
will be returned in the future but don't know when so Future interace has been defined for this.

Now what we will do is we make thread pool of 2 thread using executorservice and then call 4 callable tasks..

public class CallableDemo {
	 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Pool of 2 threads
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
        System.out.println("Submitting callable tasks " + new Date());
        Future<String> f1 = executor.submit(new MyCallable("Callable task-1"));
        Future<String> f2 = executor.submit(new MyCallable("Callable task-2"));
        Future<String> f3 = executor.submit(new MyCallable("Callable task-3"));
        Future<String> f4 = executor.submit(new MyCallable("Callable task-4"));
        System.out.println("Submitted callable task " + new Date());
        
        
        // getting result 
        try {
            // Calling get() method to get the future value
            System.out.println("Value for task-1 " + f1.get() + " at " + new Date());
            System.out.println("Value for task-2 " + f2.get() + " at " + new Date());
            while(!f3.isDone()) {
                System.out.println("Waiting for task-3 to complete " + f2.get());
                TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(500);
            }
            System.out.println("Value for task-3 after it is completed " + f3.get() + " at " + new Date());
            System.out.println("Value for task-4 " + f4.get() + " at " + new Date());
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (ExecutionException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
 
 
class MyCallable implements Callable<String> {
   String str;
   MyCallable(String str){
       this.str = str;
   }
   @Override
   public String call() throws Exception {
       System.out.println("In call method, thread name- " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
       TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(2);
       return str;
   }
   
}
